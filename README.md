Usage
-------------
When a shopper chooses the Bitcoin payment method, they will be redirected to Bitpay.com where they will pay an invoice.  Bitpay will then notify your Xcart system that the order was paid for.  The customer will be presented with a button to return to your store.  

The order status in the admin panel will be "Processed" if payment has been confirmed. 

Note: This extension does not provide a means of automatically pulling a current BTC exchange rate for presenting BTC prices to shoppers.
